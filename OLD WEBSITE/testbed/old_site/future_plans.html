  <p class="content" align="left"><b>Because of the high cost of modern instrumentation 
    for research and characterization of materials, it is clear that the only 
    way a university can acquire and maintain these instruments is through provisions 
    for their common use. This has been done successfully at other universities, 
    notably, MIT, the University of Illinois, University of Florida, Stanford, 
    etc. At USC the CEMMA executive committee is constantly evaluating the needs 
    of researchers for the latest instrumentation and considering the acquisition 
    of new instruments and the replacement of older instruments as they become 
    obsolete. Possible additions in the future include instruments for scanning 
    tunneling microscopy, surface analysis, x-ray topography, elemental trace 
    analysis and chemical bonding studies.</b></p>
