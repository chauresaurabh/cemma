<!-- summary -->
      <p class="content"><b>This instrument uses a focussed electron beam to excite 
        atoms of the specimen in their inner shells. When these excited atoms 
        decay non-rediatively, Auger electrons are emitted. The Auger electrons 
        can only be distinguished from the backscattered electrons if they come 
        from depths of the order of 1 nm and hence this instrument provides capability 
        for surface analysis. Scanning of the incident electron beam provides 
        the possibility of obtaining a two-dimensional distribution of elements 
        present at the surface at a concentration level greater than 0.1%. With 
        the use of an ion beam to sputter away the surface atoms, the depth distribution 
        of various elements with atomic number greater than 2 can be obtained. 
        The smallest region that can be analyzed is limited principally by the 
        loss of signal as the spot size of the incident beam is reduced. However, 
        in favorable cases, it is possible to utilize spot sizes as small as 50 
        nm.</b></p>
