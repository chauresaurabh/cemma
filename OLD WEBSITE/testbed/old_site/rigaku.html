<!-- summary -->
      <p class="content"><b>The X-ray source is a 12kW rotating anode X-ray generator. 
        A theta-two theta diffractometer with an intrinsic germanium solid-state 
        detector is available for doing routine powder diffraction. There is also 
        a thin-film attachment for doing work at low incidence angles as required 
        for thin-films and a texture goniometer for texture and stress measurements. 
        The entire system is computer controlled with the necessary software for 
        data collection and analysis. There is search/match capabilities and the 
        entire JCPDS file is on CD-ROM.</b></p>
