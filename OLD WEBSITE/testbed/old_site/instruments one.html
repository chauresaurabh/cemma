<p><b>The <a href="instruments.html">instruments</a> are used for both research and teaching. Hourly instrument use charges are 
applied for each instrument according to whether or not the instruments require the use of an 
operator. Special rates apply for use of a given instrument for more than 10 hours/month and for 
use of the instruments in collaborative research involving USC faculty and off-campus research 
projects.</b></p>
