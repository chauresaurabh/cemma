<p><b>Because of the high cost of modern instrumentation for research and characterization of 
materials, it is clear that the only way a university can acquire and maintain these instruments 
is through provisions for their common use. This has been done successfully at other universities, 
notably, MIT, the University of Illinois, University of Florida, Stanford, etc. At USC the CEMMA 
executive committee is constantly evaluating the needs of researchers for the latest instrumentation 
and considering the acquisition of new instruments and the replacement of older instruments as 
they become obsolete. Possible additions in the future include instruments for scanning tunneling 
microscopy, surface analysis, x-ray topography, elemental trace analysis and chemical bonding 
studies.</b></p>
