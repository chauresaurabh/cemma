<!-- summary -->
  <p class="content" align="left"><b>The instruments are used for both research 
    and teaching. Hourly instrument use charges are applied for each instrument 
    according to whether or not the instruments require the use of an operator. 
    Special rates apply for use of a given instrument for more than 10 hours/month 
    and for use of the instruments in collaborative research involving USC faculty 
    and off-campus research projects. The following instruments are included in 
    the Center for Electron Microscopy and Microanalysis and are located in the

</table>

<!-- summary -->
<p class="content"><b> This instrument uses a focussed electron beam to excite 
  atoms of the specimen in their inner shells. When these excited atoms decay 
  non-rediatively, Auger electrons are emitted. The Auger electrons can only be 
  distinguished from the backscattered electrons if they come from depths of the 
  order of 1 nm and hence this instrument provides capability for surface analysis. 
  Scanning of the incident electron beam provides the possibility of obtaining 
  a two-dimensional distribution of elements present at the surface at a concentration 
  level greater than 0.1%. With the use of an ion beam to sputter away the surface 
  atoms, the depth distribution of various elements with atomic number greater 
  than 2 can be obtained. The smallest region that can be analyzed is limited 
  principally by the loss of signal as the spot size of the incident beam is reduced. 
  However, in favorable cases, it is possible to utilize spot sizes as small as 
  50 nm. </b> </p>
