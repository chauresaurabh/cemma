Ok, just FTP the files to your server. Then point your browser to http://yourdomain/calendar.html and that's it! You must have php installed for it to work!

You can modify the style sheet to change the appearance of the calendar, and you can also add anything you want to the calendar.html file to make it fit your needs.

Thanks for downloading and come back soon!
